# Living Archipelago – Design Pack

This zip contains:
- **01_PRD.md** – gameplay-focused product requirements
- **02_spec.md** – simulation & technical specification
- **03_MVP_cut.md** – reduced MVP scope with concrete islands/goods/events
- **04_simulation_test_harness.md** – test plan + headless runner outline
- **05_studio_handoff_brief.md** – contractor/studio brief with deliverables and milestones

Recommended next step:
- Implement the **headless simulation core** first (determinism + stability), then build the UI on top of snapshots.
